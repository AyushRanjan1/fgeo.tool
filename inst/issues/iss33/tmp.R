# Ask Jess

# The sheet recruits from a first censu has different columns than the sheet recruits from a recensus. Is this expected? Will this cause any problem when the data from a first censes is to be integrated with future recensuses?

# Now the code drops empty sheets (other than the key sheets). This decision is what makes key sheets to be so. But in the light of issue 33 it may be a good time to reflect on this decision. The most conservative alternative is to drop nothing that comes in the input (and from #33 on, to add key sheets if they are missing), even if that is an empty sheet.

# Should we add a submission_id to the (single) row that flags a missing key-sheet?
